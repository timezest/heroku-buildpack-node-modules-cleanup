# Heroku Buildpack: Node Modules Cleanup

Remove all node_modules directories after the build process is completed.

### Delete the node_modules directories

The maximum allowed Heroku slug size (after compression) is 300MB. Image-heavy apps can somethings butt up against this limit, especially when using multiple buildpacks. If you're using Node.js to compile your front-end assets, but not to run your app, you may be able to save a large amount of space by deleting the `node_modules` directory before slug compilation.

## Usage

First, set the Node.js buildpack to compile your assets:

```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
```

Next, add the Node Cleanup buildpack to get rid of the `node_modules` directory:

```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:set --index 1 https://github.com/timezest/heroku-buildpack-node-modules-cleanup
```
